             <p style=" color: black;">No snarky or “clever” opening here, I’m just gonna get it out of the way. This is the question everyone wants to know the answer to: “Is it a sequel to Cloverfield?”<br><br>
                                                                        <u><b>SPOILERS</b></u>
                                                                         <br><br>

                                                                <u><b>HERE WE GO</b></u>
                                                                         <br><br>
                 It is not. Not even a little bit.
 <br><br>
Surely by now, we all know that “10 Cloverfield Lane” started as a completely different and standalone
                 movie. It had nothing to do with “Cloverfield,” and it still doesn’t. Now let me take a break while some JJ
                 fanboy points out that an AR game has connections. Yeah, that doesn’t count.<br><br>

So now that we’ve covered that the two aren’t connected except for marketing reasons, how is the
                 movie? It’s pretty good. <br><br>

The movie is very Hitchcock in the way it builds tension, atmosphere and paints the characters. Three
                 people are locked in an underground bunker. Howard (John Goodman) tells the other two that the world
                 has ended, and it is no longer safe to go outside. Because of basic human nature and a few questionable
                 holes in Howard’s story, Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) begins to plot an escape. That’s all the detail
                 I’ll go into plot-wise.<br><br>

First time director Dan Trachtenberg guides the movie with a masterful hand, hitting all the right notes
                 from laughter to seriously intense moments. Dan directs this movie with an almost unheard of amount
                 of confidence, especially for a first timer. The movie had some moments that made me lean forward and
                 kind of tense up, which is rare for me. The acting put on display here is great by all; to me, all the
                 performances felt pretty equal. The cinematography is perfectly okay. Not all that much you can do in a
                 small bunker, is there?<br><br>

“10 Cloverfield Lane” would be that kind of “Hey, this is really good check it out” under-the-radar movie
                 had it stuck with its original title “The Cellar.” With this new title slapped on to it, the movies attracts
                 expectations it will not nor could ever meet. I can see it falling prey to the “Curse of the Witch,” my
                 not-subtle-at-all reference to the backlash garnered by “Halloween 3: Season of the Witch” upon its
                 initial release. While people are wrong to judge this movie’s merits based on its marketing, so are the
                 people who are claiming this movie is great and circle jerking it just to seem “enlightened” or whatever.
                 “Woah bruh you didn’t like ‘10 Cloverfield Lane’ just because the marketing mislead you? Bruh you need
                 to get smart and all-knowing like me LOL.” The movie is a pretty good, under-the-radar sort of thing that
                 only attracted hype based on its title. That’s all and nothing more.<br><br>

Go in with no expectations, and I bet you’ll be surprised. Go in with expectations, and I’ll see you
                 <br>chugging Mountain Dew and hammering away on your keyboard throwing a tantrum.<br><br>

<b>Highlights</b>: Great atmosphere and tension, acting is tops, direction is confident <br>
<b>Lowlights</b>: The last act, its title, not at all original
