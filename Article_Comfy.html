              <br><br>
Just in case you didn’t know what “comfy” means, which raises the real question: What DOES comfy mean? 
              <br><br>
It means different things to different people, so for the sake of this list I’ll give you MY definition of it: “A movie that isn’t all that challenging, has an overt or subverted atmosphere of sadness/gloom, and most importantly, usually taking place in a cold atmosphere with close friends. The lighting of a movie is a huge factor. The movie also will usually have been first viewed at an important/impressionable time in one’s life and maybe even introduced to you or watched numerous times by yourself and a significant other.
              <br><br>
So, let’s get on to the list so you guys can get on to bitching

             <br>
             <h4  >“Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World” is basically the perfect movie for any “nerdy” 18-21 year old. The movie has mid-twenty somethings basically<br> wandering through life and slacking off. Tons of video game nods and features tons of questioning one’s success or lack thereof, not to<br> mention it is rapidly paced and easy as fuck to watch. It also takes place in a cold atmosphere.

             <br>
              <h4 class="text-left review">“In Bruges” might not qualify as comfy to most people, but minus the violence and tension, it really is<br> comfortable as fuck. It basically boils down to just two bros walking around a nice comfy town in Europe<br> musing on a variety of things. That and killing kids.

             <br><br>
             <h4 class="text-left reviews">“Adventureland” takes place in what is, for most people, the comfiest times of their lives:<br> summer in your early twenties and in an amusement park. It’s about a few college kids taking a<br> bullshit job just to try to relax and have fun before “real” life starts. It’s pretty funny and features<br> my boy Ryan Reynolds. Mixed with raunchy comedy and a genuine fear of growing up,<br> “Adventureland” lets the viewer know it’s ok to not have it all figured out just yet.

             <h4 class="text-left review">I started reading Harry Potter around ‘98, so imagine my hype when the first movie came out, AND IT<br> WAS GOOD! The first four films are very, very comfy, mostly focusing on the trio on somewhat whimsical<br> adventures. The first two feature a very lighthearted, adventurous tone, while the later two have the<br> beginnings of a darker story. From the castle to the grounds and just the overall sense of adventure,<br> come Christmas time, that ABC “Harry Potter” marathon is pure fire.

             <br><br>
             <h4 class="text-left review">One of my favorite movies is also one of the comfiest. It is purely dialogue driven and takes place in<br> the winter on a college campus. It is also directed by David Fincher, who frames everything perfectly and<br> films everything through a warm-looking lense. The soundtrack is also fucking amazing and relaxing. If<br> it’s a cold rainy night, then I’m gonna be tucked in watching the highly dramatized founding of the home<br> of everyone’s favorite slightly racist high school friends they don’t talk to anymore but still have added.

             <br><br>
             <h4 class="text-left review">So comfy doesn’t exactly have to mean good, which isn’t the case here because I consider “Superbad” to<br> be the most well written film of all time. The movie is literally a laugh (or three) a minute. It is just jam<br> packed with so many jokes and quotable lines. Added comfy if you were in high school when every single<br> “funny” kid went to Hot Topic and got a Mclovin shirt. The high school setting and the “problems” they<br> face help it be truly comfy. To go back to a time when getting beer was all we had to worry about, huh?

             <h4 class="text-left review" >“Why just ‘Fellowship?’” you might ask. Well, let me tell you: the movie is mostly lighthearted and<br> whimsical, so to speak. Everything the shire theme starts up, I know it’s time to snuggle up and get<br> comfy. The shire might literally be the comfiest place in cinema. This movie is just one of the most<br> soothing, engrossing movies out there. It’s as simple as that.

             <h4 class="text-left review">Campy, self-aware and they still hold up! Sam Raimi’s contribution to the eventual death of cinema<br> stands the test of time as charming, heartfelt entries among an ever increasing “by committee” comic<br> book movie. Long before you had to have a shared universe, long before everything was GRIMDARK,<br> there was “Spider-Man” 1 and 2, offering some silly, yet sometimes dark, slices of capeshit. The movies<br> are almost instantly comfy as Danny Elfman’s theme (that is familiar to any kid born before 95) begins to<br> play, and Peter Parker’s narration takes over as Spidey sweeps across New York City. COMFY

             <h4 class="text-left review" >The final movie on my list, “Lost in Translation” sees two disillusioned, weary, lonely people find solace in<br> each other in a land they don’t quite understand. The bright lights, the vibe and the overall laid back<br> atmosphere catapult this film to the top of my “essential rainy day under the covers” list.
