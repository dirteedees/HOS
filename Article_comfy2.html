<br><br>

A short list of movies I find myself getting completely transported in and sipping tea to.
<br><br>
<b>OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU</b><br>
I used to spend many summer nights watching this movie in my backyard.  I feel really connected to movies that take place in this era, and although it takes place in Mississippi, I feel like it's almost a part of me. I’ve actually BEEN to the big rock candy mountain! It’s kind of a backroad in Nowhere, Utah on your way to Disneyland.  They have a radio show where you can listen to big rock candy mountain, and I always quote the movie.  Also, if it weren't for this movie, I wouldn’t have any connection at all to The Odyssey. 
              <b><u>First watched: age 9</u></b>
<br><br>

<b>INDIANA JONES: RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK</b><br>
What can I say? I love this adventure movie. I aspired to be Indiana Jones at one point of my life.  I went on the ride at Disneyland before I ever saw the movie, wondering all the while, “What in the good hell could this movie be about!?” The ride was so scary and so exciting: the music, fire, and corpses!  The second we got home from that Disneyland trip, my dad sat me down, and we watched it. Everything came together for me. Everything I had ever imagined and adventure to be was this: the music, the aesthetic, the attention to detail, and my first discovered love of practical effects! Aahhhh such delicious, cartoon-y corpses, such wonderful face melting. &lt;3 My cousin and I just recently got back from Disneyland, and her experience was similar to mine. When it was my turn to sit her down and watch the movie, and that music came on, we were both so excited! I re-watch it no shame.
              <br><br>
<b><u>First watched:</u></b> age 8

<br><br>
<b>ZOMBIELAND</b><br>
I really don't know. I went through the zombie thing as we all did, and loving effects makeup, you have to kinda like zombies for being the one thing to guarantee you money. It’s a comedy, so you never really feel like anyone is in any real danger, and they make the zombie apocalypse look fun! There's just something about that scene where they just break everything that is so, so satisfying. Just wondering around, freely being able to murder people, living in Bill Murray's house... It's one of the only three movies my mom ever had on her iPhone. We would watch it while we were camping a lot when we couldn't sleep. Code red mountain dew never looked so good.  
<br><br>

<b><u>First watched:</u></b> age 17
<br><br>

<b>LOST BOYS</b><br> 
It's nostalgic, goofy, spooky, and has some great guilty pleasure actors in it: some nice eye candy and a lot of 80’s glam. Me and my friend loved vampires at the height of our gothic phase, so we watched a lot of Interview with the Vampire and a lot of Lost Boys. Interview was prettier to look at and was my first R rated movie, so I can't put on here because I wasn't exactly comfortable watching it. Lost Boys, on the other hand, was good fun for everyone!  My family could watch it with me, and my insecure gothic friend and I could watch it and still feel edgy.  We always daydreamed about how fun it would be to be a vampire in California, stalking the piers with warm sea breezes hydrating your hair to the perfect curl. 
              <br><br>
<b><u>First watched:</u></b> age 13
<br><br>

<b>THE SECRET OF KELLS</b> <br>
This movie is beautiful, and it's easy to get lost in the vibrancy of it and its characters. I love fantasy, and my first time watching this, it cast me under this spell where I was very invested and captivated. I wanted to run around in the forest with long, tangled hair, pet the fluffy cat, and go on adventures. I also really liked that the girl's name is Ashleigh (heheh).  
              <br><br>
<b><u>First watched:</u></b> age 19
<br><br>

<b>SITA SINGS THE BLUES</b> <br>
Sita Sings the Blues is not really comfortable in the way of its context but the idea of it and how/where I was when I watched it. It was my first time living out of state by myself far away from home. I had just gone through my first BIG, BIG break up, and I watched Sita on the shaky Wi-Fi I was stealing from my neighbors on YouTube in my broom closet sized apartment. I love the music sequences with Annette Hanshaw, its unique storytelling, the fact that it’s free to the public for everyone to view. It's actually a really good reference point for Hinduism for me. When I see statues and paints from the Hindu religion, I know who they are now. The animation is very unique and colorful, and the improv shadow puppets that tie the story together are so creative!  It all comes together and makes sense to me by this woman drawing these things together by talking about her divorce. You walk away from it feeling like you really learned something in this gentle sort of way.
